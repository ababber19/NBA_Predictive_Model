# NBA_Predictive_Model
Using webscraping, I have developed a comprehensive database of all NBA players' statistics from 1951-2020 (total of 3,483 players).

I then create a logistic model to predict playersâ€™ likelihood of career success based on their first two years' statistics (accuracy: 57%)

I define career success by the total minutes played in the five years directly after their sophomore year (years 3-8).
